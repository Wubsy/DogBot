# DogBot
Horrible rip-off of CatBot that I add a ton of commands to just for the meme

###### Me
I'm pretty new to this whole github and Golang thing so don't use big words :stuck_out_tongue:

# Libraries
Requires:
```
github.com/Time6628/OpenTDB-Go
github.com/valyala/fasthttp
github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo
```

# Setup
## Downloading Libraries
Implying you already have Golang installed correctly you should be able to do the following command in command prompt
```
>go get github.com/User/Repo
```
for example, the first one would be
```
>go get github.com/Time6628/OpenTDB-Go
```
It will seem to be doing nothing for awhile but until it asks for a new command, it's best just to wait.

If you get an error about gopath/goroot, you have likely not installed Go correctly.

#### Notices
There might be an issue with capitalization in your IDE. The `github.com/Time6628/OpenTDB-Go` may act weird so you just have to lowercase the letters into `github.com/time6628/opentdb-go` in the ```import()```
